# Simple makefile for packaging Roku Simple Video Player example
#
# Makefile Usage:
# > make
# > make install
# > make remove
#
# Important Notes: 
# To use the "install" and "remove" targets to install your
# application directly from the shell, you must do the following:
#
# to exclude certain files from being added to the zipfile during packaging
# include a line like this:ZIP_EXCLUDE= -x keys\*
# that will exclude any file who's name begins with 'keys'
# to exclude using more than one pattern use additional '-x <pattern>' arguments
# ZIP_EXCLUDE= -x \*.pkg -x storeassets\*
#
# 1) Make sure that you have the curl command line executable in your path
# 2) Set the variable ROKU_DEV_TARGET in your environment to the IP 
#    address of your Roku box. (e.g. export ROKU_DEV_TARGET=192.168.1.1.
#    Set in your this variable in your shell startup (e.g. .bashrc)
